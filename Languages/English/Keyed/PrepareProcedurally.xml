	<VariationTooltip>Procedural generation will try to pick pawn backstories and simulate randomization to quickly arrive at a certain loadout of passions. It does so by attaching a weight for each skill and picking stories by the best weight.\n\nVarying this weight by a random amount on generation gives more backstory variety and can help get out of ruts without having to specify each weight to get a specific story combination.</VariationTooltip>

	<PassionPointsDescriptionTooltip>When characters are generated, they are given a range of points between 0-9, based on a normal distribution centered at five points. Outliers on the far ends (i.e. exactly 0 or 9) are exceedingly unlikely.\n\n    - Minor passions take 1 point\n    - Major passions take 1.5 points\n\nCertain traits can force or prevent passions, but otherwise a set amount of major and minor passions are given based on the skill level for the pawn generated.</PassionPointsDescriptionTooltip>
