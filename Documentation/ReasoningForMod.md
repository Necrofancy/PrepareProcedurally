There are a lot of existing mods out there to help speed up colony creation or make characters more precise in some fashion, and Prepare Procedurally is just another one on the pile. In this, I'll go over my thoughts on the existing field which led to me creating this mod in particular.

# The Two Schools of Thought For Starting Colony Preparation

There are basically two schools of thought on existing mods in this area - do you allow full editorial control over a character's attributes, or do you try to respect the pawn generation rules and find ones that are interesting to your colony?

## Allow editing pawns after they are generated
Mods like Pawn Editor, Character Editor, or Prepare Carefully all provide full editorial control over a given pawn. You can add as many traits as you want, push skills and passions as much as you want, and basically do anything you want with them. 

One of the major problems is compatibility with other mods, or stability across the board. When you're making complete overhauls to pawns, including but not limited to changing the race/`ThingDef` of the pawn itself, there is a _lot_ that can go wrong. The mod community that helps out users in troubleshooting, in particular, is extremely weary of helping to rescue saves that have been irreparably corrupted from the wrong thing happening from these mods. I, myself, run a very small set of mods because I am _extremely_ impatient when it comes to unexpected debugging in the middle of my gameplay.

That being said, I don't think that a comprehensive-yet-stable pawn editor is an impossibility, and I wish the mod authors the best of luck in their endeavors, but that's not my intent or goal with Prepare Procedurally. Making a fully-functional editor is laborious work, and I'm not even especially interested in having _full_ control over the creation process - I'm actually more interested in making starts happen more quickly. Those who are interested in precise edits to characters may even get some benefits out of using Prepare Procedurally to quickly generate a baseline of colonists, and then fine-tune to their desires with their full-editor mod of choice.
        
## Don't edit pawns at all, but randomize pawns until they meet certain criterion.
Prepare Moderately and Random+ are mods that take this tack, and won't touch pawn generation or editing at all. Instead, they take the tack of providing some filter sets for pawns, and repeatedly randomizing until the pawn matches all filter requirements.

While this does guarantee that the mod author hasn't made any assumptions about how pawn generation works, it instead thrusts all of that responsibility onto the user. Part of this development work on this mod started because of the amount of poking around I was doing into pawn generation to try to figure out how to make reasonable filters in the first place.

How much does adding an aristic passion to your list of requirements increase the amount of time it takes to find a pawn that matches everything? Does filtering out addictions and permanent injuries dramatically increase the amount of time it will take to randomize pawns? How about ages - will setting an age range from 20-40 be more reasonable than 20-30? If so, how much?

# Design Goal : Make 'Worse' Pawns Faster

As an example, let's look at this pawn generated by Prepare Procedurally:

This is an utterly regular pawn. It's about the exact average or mean of passions - two major plus two minor is five passion points, the center of the gaussian distribution that pawn generation will use. Those passions are applied to a specific combination of shuffled backstories, which all have equal distributions in the offworld category. This will take into the high thousands of pawn rerolls to get this kind of pawn, specifically, just filtering by age and to pick up the specified passions.

I think that, leveraging how backstories and other factors can influence pawn generation, that "worse" pawns can be generated much faster. So my goal is to have an even-closer-to-vanilla experience of working with flawed pawns, almost as fast as just instantly hitting next on the character creation menu.
