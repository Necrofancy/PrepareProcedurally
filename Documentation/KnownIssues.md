# Currently Known Issues

In roughly order of priority, these are summaries of known issues:

* "Animals" can be set to be a major or minor passion on a character that, due to their backstory, will have "Handling" worktype disabled.
    * This is because Handling and Hunting are both animals-relevant works. A Hunter will benefit from the skill regardless of their ability to Handle, so the game will display in that case.
    * This is probably not be what players are wanting when they specify that they want a pawn that has a strong passion in Animals.
* Traits affecting pawn's final skills will lead to going over the maximum passion points. With the default of 7.0, this is still roughly fine.
