Procedural rules given certain other attributes of the game.

Some examples:  
* ByBiome - Intended to change mining requirements based on hilliness of your chosen terrain
* ByPrecept - Add some light changes to requirement based on a precept of your ideology

Some ideas I had in mind, haven't really implemented, and may revisit at some point:  
* Configuration to set a "strong" setup leveraging the most of pawn generation (the default is purposefully minimal)
* Specialist-focused precepts to try to custom-design around e.g. a Production Specialist.
  * I don't know if this is even necessary anymore with the EditSpecificPawn.cs UI.
